# Spam Classifier using NLP

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a spam classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails or text messages as spam or non-spam based on their content. 

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of labeled emails or text messages, where each message is labeled as spam or non-spam. 

- `spam_data.csv`: The dataset containing labeled messages.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the text data by tokenizing, removing stop words, and performing other text cleaning operations.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the text data using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for building the spam classifier.
4. **Model Training**: Train the selected models on the preprocessed text data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models to improve performance.
7. **Prediction**: Make predictions on new messages using the trained model.

## Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:
